## Develop and build

- Local dev: no build required. Serve root with `python -m http.server 8000` (or equivalent) and open http://localhost:8000/.
- CI build: Parcel bundles on GitHub Actions with contentâ€‘hashed assets and rewrites references automatically; Pages serves `dist/`.
- To test the build locally (optional):
  - Install Node 20 and Yarn (Corepack works: `corepack enable`)
  - `yarn install`
  - `yarn build`
  - Serve `dist/`: `python3 -m http.server 8000 -d dist`
